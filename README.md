# Bookworm
This is a basic learning project to create an app for tracking the books you’ve read and your thoughts on them. The app displays a list of books with their ratings, allows you to view detailed information about each book, and lets you add new ratings for books.

The source learning is from the 11th of course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

## Goals
1. Display a list of books you’ve read, each with its rating.
2. Allow users to tap a book in the list to view detailed information about its rating and review.
3. Include a toolbar button to navigate to a form for adding a new book and its rating.
4. Provide an intuitive interface for viewing and managing your book ratings.
5. Save and persist book information for future reference.
